# Lean-4.0-LLL

This repository contains a formal proof of the [Asymmetric Lov√°sz Local Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lov%C3%A1sz_local_lemma) (and the symmetric corollary) in Lean 4.0. The proof closely follows (in both notation and logical structure) the one [here](https://theory.stanford.edu/~jvondrak/MATH233A-2018/Math233-lec02.pdf). 

### History

This proof began in Lean 3.0 as the midterm and final project of the Fall 2022 iteration of the Interactive Theorem Proving course (21-321) at Carnegie Mellon University, taught by Professor Jeremy Avigad. The Lean 3.0 code can be found [here](https://github.com/nsglover/lean-lovasz-local-lemma).
